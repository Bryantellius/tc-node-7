Write an app to help people track their cell phone usage. Cell phone
plans for this particular company give you a certain number of minutes every 30 days
which must be used or they are lost (no rollover). We want to track the average number
of minutes used per day and inform the user if they are using too many minutes or can
afford to use more.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the following pieces of data:

• Number of minutes in the plan per 30 day period, m
• The current day in the 30 day period, d
• The total number of minutes used so far u

The program should then compute whether the user is over, under, or right on the average
daily usage under the plan. It should also inform them of how many minutes are left
and how many, on average, they can use per day for the rest of the month. Of course, if
they’ve run out of minutes, it should inform them of that too.

For example, if the user enters m = 250, d = 10, and u = 150, your program should print
out something similar to the following.

10 days used, 20 days remaining
Average daily use: 15 min/day
You are EXCEEDING your average daily use (8.33 min/day),
continuing this high usage, you'll exceed your minute plan by
200 minutes.
To stay below your minute plan, use no more than 5 min/day.

Write a program that prompts the user for an x and a y coordinate in
the Cartesian plane and prints out a message indicating if the point (x, y) lies on an axis
(x or y axis, or both) or what quadrant it lies in

A triangle can be characterized in terms of the length of its three sides.
In particular, an equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides being equal. A
triangle such that two sides have the same length is isosceles and a triangle with all three
sides having a different length is scalene. Examples of each can be found in Figure 3.5.
In addition, the three sides of a triangle are valid only if the sum of any two sides is
strictly greater than the third length.

Write a program to read in three numbers as the three sides of a triangle. If the three
sides do not form a valid triangle, you should indicate so. Otherwise, if valid, your
program should output whether or not the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
